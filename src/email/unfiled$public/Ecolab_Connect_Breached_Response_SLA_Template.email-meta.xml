    <subject>IMPORTANT: Ecolab Connect {!Case.CaseNumber} Breached Response SLA</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello,

Case {!Case.CaseNumber} - {!Case.Subject} has been assigned to your queue but has not yet been assigned to an Agent within the defined timeframe of our Service Level Agreement (SLA).  An Agent needs to accept the assignment of this case as soon as possible via the Salesforce Service Cloud Console in order to maintain our customer support and satisfaction levels.

Thank you,

Ecolab Support Team
